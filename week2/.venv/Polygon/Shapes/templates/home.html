        <h1>Triangle</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Fact:</strong>
            Did you know that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle always equals 180 degrees? This is known as the Triangle Angle Sum Theorem.

        <h1>Square</h1>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong>
            Squares have four lines of symmetry. 
            That means you can fold a square in four different ways and get two halves that match exactly. 
            You can fold a square along its diagonals, which are the lines that connect opposite corners, or along its midlines, which are the lines that cut the square in half horizontally or vertically.

        <h1>Circle</h1>
        <p><strong>Fact:</strong>
            The ratio of a circle‚Äôs circumference (the distance around it) to its diameter (the longest distance across it) is a special number called pi, which is about 3.14. 
            You can use pi to find the area and circumference of any circle.</p>
